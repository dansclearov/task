## _**TODO List API**_

### **Description**

Develop an API for a TODO application using **Django**, **DRF** frameworks and **PostgreSQL** as database option. Use a separate python **virtual enviroment** for this project (tool on your choice). Create a main model named _Note_ for storing created TODO notes.

**_Note_** model should have the following fields: _id, title, description, date/time fields (created_at, updated_at)_ and other fields on your choice or need.

**This API should have endpoints for:**

- TODO note **CRUD** operations (create, read, update and delete)
- mark/unmark one note as favourite
- list only favourites notes
- search in notes
- order notes
- filter notes

**Optional features**:

- JWT authentication (_link TODO notes to user_)
- Docker image (_write a simple docker file_)
- Swagger (_expose a swagger documentation_)
- Any other perks are welcome :)
